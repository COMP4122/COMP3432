## Introduction

This is the group project for COMP3432 Innovative Computing Paradigm class at HK PolyU. This is a two-player game on the Android platform.  

We decided to make this game because we miss the old days when there were plenty of local multiplayer games. Nowadays we are getting better and better graphics, but games tend to focus on competitions instead of cooperation. So we made a casual game in which players can beat levels in a happy and relaxed atmosphere. We focus on making levels that require cooperations.  

Player one controls the left and right movement, and player two controls the up and down movement. They can also make the ball jump by rising their phones quickly at the same time.  

Everyone who has played this game agree that this game is super fun and can certainly connect them with their friends.  

This game is currently available only on Android platform. But we do plan to release it on the AppStore in the near future, after polishing it, and sharing the joy with more people.
